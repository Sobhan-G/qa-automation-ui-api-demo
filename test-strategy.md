# Test Strategy

## Goal
Demonstrate a realistic QA approach to automation by combining UI and API testing.

## Scope
- Authentication flows
- Core business functionality
- Data validation through backend APIs

## Automation Approach
- UI tests cover critical user journeys
- API tests validate backend responses and data integrity
- Automation focuses on stability and repeatability

## Out of Scope

- Performance testing
- Visual regression testing

## Reasoning
Automation is applied where it provides the highest value and supports fast feedback.
